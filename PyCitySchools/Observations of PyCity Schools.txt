Pandas Challenge - PyCity Schools
	The average reading score was higher than the average math score in almost every school and grade.
	Both the math and reading average scores stayed roughly the same between grades.  There tended to be a tiny decline in the higher grades compared to 9th grade.
	
	Contrary to the expectation, but both math and reading had higher average scores and much higher % passing in the bins with fewer spending per student.
	The small and medium sized schools had simiar scores and passing % across the board, but the large schools were lower in averages due to having a much lower % passing.

	The Charter and District schools were fairly close in average reading score, but a good distance from average math scores.  The % passing math and reading were a complete landslide in favor of Charter schools.
